# Challenge Instructions
# Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. They were rated on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.
# The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].
# If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
# If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
# Comparison points are the total points a person earned.

# Solution:
def compare_triplets(a, b)
  alice_score = 0
  bob_score = 0

  # Compare the elements of a and b one by one using a for loop
  for i in 0...a.length
    if a[i] > b[i]
      alice_score += 1
    elsif a[i] < b[i]
      bob_score += 1
    end
  end

  [alice_score, bob_score]
end

# Example usage:
result1 = compareTriplets([5, 6, 7], [3, 6, 10])
puts result1.inspect
# Output: [1, 1]

result2 = compareTriplets([17, 28, 30], [99, 16, 8])
puts result2.inspect
# Output: [2, 1]
